Do you have any raisins? No? Well then, how about a date?
Can I get a picture of you so I can show Santa what I want for Christmas?
Shall we talk or continue flirting from a distance?
I saw you across the room and knew I had to meet you. What’s your name?
Hi, I saw you and thought, ‘I’m gonna kick myself all night if I don’t at least come over and say Hi.’ So … Hi. What’s your name?
I feel a little embarrassed about this … but I’d like to meet you. What’s your name?
What do you think of the band?
You look really familiar. Have we taken a class together?
Do you have the time?
