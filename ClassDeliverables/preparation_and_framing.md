## Background and context: 
What information about your project does the audience need to participate fully in the technical review? You should share enough to make sure your audience understands the questions you are asking, but without going into unnecessary detail.

We are making a Tinderbot that will take user inputs, like name, keyword, or category and return a pick-up line related to one of the inputs.  We are going to be gathering pick-up lines from the internet, assembling them into a database and searching through that database for pick-up lines relevant to the userâ€™s input.  

## Key questions: 
What do you want to learn from the review? What are the most important decisions your team is currently contemplating? Where might an outside perspective be most helpful? As you select key questions to ask during the review, bear in mind both the time limitations and background of your audience.

We are apprehensive about the creation of our database and the best method for accumulating data from sites such as reddit, pickup-lines.net, and pickuplinesgalore.com.  We are also looking for feedback on machine learning since we do not have much experience with it and are looking to rely heavily on machine learning to teach our bot humor.

Key questions:
 - What type of matching/searching algorithm is best (keyword search, categories, or autonomously generated)? Do we want multiple?
 - What are different ways we can incorporate machine learning?

## Agenda for technical review session:
Be specific about how you plan to use your allotted time. What strategies will you use to communicate with your audience?

We will be creating a slideshow and talking about our idea as we go through it.
