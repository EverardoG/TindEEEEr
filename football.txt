Do you play football? Because you've got a tight end.
You're so hot, I'd let you penetrate my defense.
Consider this your two-minute warning... before I kiss you.
Do you prefer two hand touch or full contact?
I like your Patriots jersey, but I bet it'd look even better on my bedroom floor.
I'm gonna go for two after I score.
I'd love to touchdown in your end zone.
Instead of zone defense, can we try some man-to-woman coverage tonight?
How about we kick off a new relationship tonight?
I've never made an incomplete pass, and I hope you won't be my first.
Wanna be my receiver tonight?
Are you going to ask me out soon, or do I need to call a delay of game penalty?
Are you an eligible receiver... of my phone number?
I wish you were on the team because I'd love to see your backfield in motion.
