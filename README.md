# Pick-up Line Bot
Pick-up Line Bot is a pick-up line generator that provides individualized pick-up lines based on category or name based inputs. 

## Using Pick-Up Line Bot
You can interact with Pick-Up Line Bot directly on Tinder as soon as we get it up and running again or on our website [here](https://pickuplinebot.herokuapp.com/) or [here] (https://elizabethtawes.github.io/Tinderbot_site/). 

## Downloading and Running the Code
In order to run the Pick-Up Line Bot on your own computer, you must first install the following dependencies.
* Datamuse
* Praw
* PyEnchant
* BeautifulSoup4
* RoboBrowser
* Pynder
You can install them by typing the following into your terminal if running Linux. Note that you will need to have installed pip for this to work effectively. Here's a [link](https://www.tecmint.com/install-pip-in-linux/) that will help with that. 
```
$ pip3 install python-datamuse
$ pip install praw
$ pip install pyenchant
$ pip install beautifulsoup4
$ pip install robobrowser
$ pip install git+https://github.com/charliewolf/pynder.git
```
Additionally, you should clone our git repository.

```
git clone https://github.com/EverardoG/TindEEEEr
```

## Getting Started
Once you’ve cloned our repository, navigate to the directory and run categories_mvp.py to run the categories based pick-up line search.  To interact with the name based pick-up lines, run names_functions.py with a name as an argument in string format. You can run these by typing:

```
$ python categories_mvp.py
```
for the categories and
```
$ python names_functions.py
```
for the names.

## Attributions
We couldn’t make the Pick-up Line Bot on our own! We also had help from Paul Ruvolo, the SoftDes Ninjas, the creators of the various libraries described in the dependencies as well as the many people who have contributed pick-up lines via training or internet posts. 

## Liscense
Pick-up Line Bot does not yet have a defined licence.
