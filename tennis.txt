If we were playing tennis, I’d let you score all the points so I’ll always be in Love.
Do you want to be my doubles partner for life?
Wanna play some tennis? I got one racket and two balls.
Are you Roger Federer’s ground strokes? Cause baby you’re so elegant.
Excuse me miss, could you hold my balls while I get my huge racket out of my bag?
If you will be my racket, I’ll be your ball. Serve me.
You know what else is a nice match? You and me.
I grunt harder than anyone else on the tennis courts.
Girl, are you a lob? Cause I'm going to smash you
I’m not a tennis player but I’ll still grunt if you hit my balls.
Is that a ball in your pocket or are you just excited to see me.
I’m happy to fetch your balls for you. You hit them as hard as you like.
You’re looking like a tennis ball. I just wanna hit it.
If you can return my serve, I’ll return your call.
Your court or mine?
For you, I’d give unlimited lets.
Play tennis here often?
Tired of singles? Let’s play some doubles.
Trust me, the only time I’d play games with you is on the court.
Girl get rid of those Dunlop balls, you deserve better.
Care to knock a few balls with me?
I will give you Yonex, you can give me Head.
So, what’s your favorite stroke?
Smash or pass? In tennis I’ll do both.
I can hurl it 130 MPH down the middle.
That was a pretty deep shot girl, but I’ll be even deeper inside..
