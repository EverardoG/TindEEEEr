You may have heard that I'm a great ballhandler. Wanna sample my skills?
Your Jordan jersey looks nice, but I bet it'd look even nicer on my bedroom floor.

If you were a basketball, I'd never shoot. Because I would always miss you.
You be the Bulls and I'll bring the Heat!
If you were a basketball, would you let me lay you up?
