Are you a cornfield? Cause I'm stalking you
I wish I was your derivative so I could lie tangent in your curves
Are you a Pokemon? Because I want a Pikachu
I love the Google one!
the ones I saw from the survey responses look golden.
It's pants off o' clock, but my watch is 10 minutes fast
If you were an endoplasmic reticulum how would you want me, smooth or rough?
If you were a booger, I'd pick you first.
Someone call life alert, cause I've fallen for you and I can't get up.
