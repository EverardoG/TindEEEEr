Baby you’re so sweet you’d put Hershey's out of business!
You look like you could use some hot chocolate... Well, here I am!
Girl, you remind me of a box of chocolates, because I want to take your top off.
Hershey’s makes millions of kisses a day. All I’m asking for is one from you.
I was going to get you a box of chocolates, but you already have a sweeter box.
You break my heart into 15 unique, chewable pieces... just like a Whitman's Sampler.
You’re like my favourite chocolate bar - half sweet and half nuts!
Sweet Marie, the moment I saw you, I knew I would Skor and have you screaming 'Oh Henry' by the end of the night!
