I know the air is pretty thin up there, why don't you lay in my bed and catch your breath?
You’re a tall drink of water - and I’m thirsty!
I want to climb you like a jungle gym.
How much does it cost to ride to the top?
I'm 6'7" standing up... and 9" laying down.
I'm tall because... I'm standing on my wallet.
Will you have my NBA babies?
You know, we’re all the same height laying down...
The best part about being this tall is that it is easy to see cute girls like you in a crowd.
You would totally be worth the climb!
I bet that back is real toned from keeping the rest of you upright.
Do you play basketball?
I'm six-foot-six and EVERYTHING is in proportion.
I'm six-foot-five, but I'd like to be six feet under you
You are tall enough to ride this ride!
Can you do me a favor and grab me that book off the shelf for me... and then hand me your phone number?
You know, it's been a while since I climbed a tree.
If everything was in proportion, I'd be 9'3"
(One tall person to another) Finally, someone I can see eye-to-eye on everything with!
(One tall person to another) It's nice how easy it is for us to check each other out across the room. We should go sit down somewhere though so the next tallest people have a chance.
