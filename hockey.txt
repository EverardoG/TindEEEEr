Nice Skates... wanna puck?
You know, less teeth means more tongue!

Do you have a jersey? Because I need your name and number.
You wanna be my equipment manager?
Wanna go for a ride on my Zam-boner?
I bet I can score on your 5-hole I've got a curved stick.
I'm good on the ice, but I'm GREAT in bed!
My skateblade's not the only thing made of steel.

Can I slip one past your goalie?
