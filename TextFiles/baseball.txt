I'm falling in glove with you.
I hope you're good at catching cause I'm starting to fall for you.
You're quite the catch, baby.
I'm an umpire - give me your number so I can make the call.
Are we in the bullpen? Cuz you're warming me up.
Are you in the outfield? Because you're an angel.
You know, I've never needed a third base coach to wave me home.
My dugout, or yours?
Us baseball players know our way around the bases.
I'd lay down a sacrifice for you.
I'd got to bat for you, babe.
Can I pinch hit on you?
If you date me, you'll eventually see a diamond.
