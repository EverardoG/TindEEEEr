Wanna take a shower with me to conserve water?
I don't drive a car, but I'd love to walk you home!
Are you a tree hugger? Cause you're about to get some wood.
I bet your Dad is an Environmentalist, because you are so eco-friendly
You blow my mind like Geothermal Heating Technology!
Your eyes are as bright as energy saving halogen light bulbs, would you light up my life?
What time do you get off work? Let's carpool it back to my place.
You must be a garden, cause I'm digging you.
I'm against animal cruelty, so don't hurt my monkey, please stroke it gently.
If I wrote you a protest song, would you sing it with me?
Youâ€™re so hot you must've started all of this darn global warming
Like the bamboo sheets on your bed I want to cover you with sustainable love!
Are all your appliances energy efficient? Because when I saw you the room became more environmentally friendly!
Since cars pollute, can I pick you up on my electric scooter?
