Do you have a sunburn, or are you always this hot?
I'm drowning in the sun and need mouth to mouth now!
I hope you know CPR, because you’re taking my breath away
Hear that? The ocean wants you to join me for a drink.
If you were a beach, I’d pick you to lay on.
Can I swim in your eyes on a hot summer day?
How was your last skinny dip? I bet I can make your next one better.
Nice beach balls, can I play?
I don't know which is prettier today, the water, the sky or your eyes.
They called me the human torpedo even before I took up swimming.
Let’s go back to my place and get out of these wet clothes.
If beauty were a grain of sand, you’d be a million beaches.
You’re a wealthy neglected housewife, I’m a pool boy. It's practically required by law that you do me.
I wanna pound you the way the ocean pounds the surf.
I wish I'd brought my towel, can I share yours?
