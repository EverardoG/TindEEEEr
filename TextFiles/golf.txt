I just finished a round of golf, wanna be my 19th hole today?
I hope you like it rough because I don't replace my divots.
Your putt looks great in those jeans.
Wanna be my caddy? You look like you'd be a great ball-washer.
So what's it gonna be today, Stroke Play or Skins?
How about grabbing two of your friends so we can play a foursome?
I'm a bit tired, so can we just play your backside tonight?
I'm still working on my approach, but I think I have a pretty good swing.
I'm known on the tour for having a lengthy club.
Are you sure you aren't all four majors? Because you would be a grand slam!
Are you looking for the fairway? Because coming back to my hotel is the only fair way for this evening to go.
From the moment I saw you, I've had a vertical shaft angle.
Hey girl, I can make your V-jay sing!
I'm like the US Open... hard and long!
