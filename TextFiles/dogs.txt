I came here looking for a little tail.
Is it warm in here, or are you in heat?
I'll sniff your butt if you sniff mine.
Whoa! Look at THOSE puppies!!
You had me at ruff.
When I say 'bitch', I mean it as a compliment!
Hey baby, meeting you has given me a new leash on life.
You can pee on my fire hydrant all night long.
Come on, don't make me beg!
Hey there, beautiful... looking for an Alpha dog?
Hey Gorgeous, can I buy you a liver treat?
Did you win "best in show"? Because you sure are a winner to me.
Knick-knack, Paddy-wack, you just gave this dog a bone. 
Since chocolate is toxic to me, how 'bout a little sugar?
A day with you is like an eternity of behind-the-ear scratches.
Do you pee here often?
I must be a Dog Tick, because I'm stuck on you.
Baby, you are what I call a hot dog!
You smell so familiar
Your doghouse or mine?
Sniff my butt. It’s the quickest way to my heart.
Can I get you a tennis ball?
I am looking for a leash-free relationship.
Do you pee here often?
It was love at first sniff.
I love to be pawed.
I’ve crossed all the dog parks in the world to find you.
You make me want to be a more obedient dog.
Hey girl, want to help me bury my bone?
Is your tail always wagging, or are you just happy to see me?
