Hey girl! Wanna slide down my pole?
If you play with fire, you’ll end up burnt. If you play with a firefighter you’ll end up wet!
I’m on fire - you wanna stop, drop and roll with me?
I could make you scream louder than the fire siren.
I don’t have a very long hose, but I’ve got one hell of a pumper!
I’m going to ride you like a fire truck on a bad stretch of road on the way to a 6 alarm fire!
Can I hit your hydrant?
Did u know that firefighters are professional hose handlers?
It’s my job to go in when it’s extremely Hot and I never pull out until it’s dripping wet!
Don’t prime the pump unless you want to squirt a little water.
You know, firefighters have the longest hoses!
I’m a firefighter... I run into burning buildings to save complete strangers, imagine what I would do for you.
They call me "The Fireman"... mainly because I turn the hoes on.
The fire might be out but you are still smoking hot.
The hotter you get, the faster we come!
Firefighters are always in heat.
Your so hot, a firefighter couldn’t put you out.
I would climb you like a ladder.
I save babies, puppies, and kittens. And I look forward to saving you from a boring life!
The first rule for a patient is to remove all restricting clothing. Can I go ahead and start now?﻿
As a fireman, I’m an expert in what’s hot.
Nice hose, does it pump?
