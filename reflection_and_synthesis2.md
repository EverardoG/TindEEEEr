# Reflection and Synthesis 2 Document
## Feedback and Descisions
Our main focus for this feedback session was based around the user interface and seeing what people thought about our MVPs. We were given the suggestion to have the Tinderbot send a pickup line when it matches with someone on Tinder. We'll incorporate features like this moving forward so that the bot isn't simply a program that you input names and keywords into; rather, the Tinderbot will have a fun and charming personality. We are now curious as to what other features we could implement to make it so that our users have fun interacting with the Tinderbot.

## Review Process Reflection
Our review was a lot of fun! Our audience followed along with our presentation and enjoyed interacting with some of our MVPs that showed the basic keywords/categories search as well as the names search. The feedback was centered around the user interface side of our Tinderbot as we had hoped. Our planned agenda was a quick rundown of how our code worked, and an extended discussion on our user interface while we let people interact with our MVP. For a more effective technical review, we could have focused more on not just what people thought of the user interface, but specifically what was bad about it. Soliciting feedback on what to change could be very helpful to us in the future since people automatically gave us positive feedback and didn't give us many suggestions for specific changes.
