Girl, you're so fine you could make an impression on Monet.
Are you a Shepard Fairey poster? Because I can’t believe you don’t already belong to someone else.
At first I thought I was looking at a Monet, but you’re so much more beautiful up close.
Are you into monochrome? Because I’d love to use my charcoal to color us black and white.
Are you a medium? Because I'd like to paint you on carpet.
Are you an antiques collector? Because I have some junk that hasn't been touched in years.
Aren’t you the model from my figure drawing class?
Have you ever posed nude?
Call the Art Loss Register, because you just stole my heart.
If I told you I like your body of work, would you hold it against me?
Is your dad an art thief? Because you are a masterpiece.
Vincent Van Gogh out with me
You must be an artist, because I find myself drawn to you.
If I were an art critic, I'd give you a ravishing review.
