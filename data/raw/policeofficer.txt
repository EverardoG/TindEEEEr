Anything you say can and will be used against you… so say my name baby!
If being sexy was a crime, you'd be guilty as charged.
Anything you say can and will be used against you in a court of my bed.
Stop! Don't you know it is illegal to look that fine?
Do you know how fast you were going when you fell from heaven?
Spread em’!!
I have a great idea for those handcuffs.
Bullproof vest? Nah, it's all muscle.
Ever seen a baton this big?
I’d love you to frisk me.
I'm ready to enforce the law of attraction.
I'm writing you a ticket - you’ve got ”fine" written all over you.
Is that a gun in your pocket, or are you just happy to see me?
Let's go to my place for some under-cover work.
My cuffs or your cuffs tonight?
Nice uniform, it would look great at the foot of my bed.
I hear cops like a big bust.
Want to plant something on me?
Want to play good cop bad cop?
You have the right to remain silent, but I doubt you will.
What else do you do with that night stick?
I always turn on my siren when I spot a siren.
Did I tell you that I live next door to Dunkin Donuts?
Step out of the vehicle. Walk a straight line into my life.
Stick with me and those lights won’t be the only thing flashing.
I'm not here to bust you... I'm here for your bust.
