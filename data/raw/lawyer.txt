Why don't you take a look at my briefs?
I believe that it's in our best interest to comply with section 69 of the act.
I'd have to plead insanity if I ever left you.
If loving you is a crime, then I'm looking at a life sentence.
Excuse me, are you into reverse bifurcation?
When I think of you, I become fully vested.
I've got a precedent that's long and deep.
Is your estate subject to open?
I don't know if I have standing, but I'd love to court you.
I'll teach you about jurisdiction if we change the venue to my place.
I think I'd be liable for negligence if I neglected to come over and talk to you.

There is no burden of proof for how fine you are.
I love you beyond a reasonable doubt.
Let me show you my mens rea.
When I bring an ejectment action, there'll be nothing quiet about your enjoyment.
'Res ipsa loquitur', honey. Your hot body speaks for itself!
Your body is 'ultra vires', it's beyond my power to control myself around you.
