Do you work at Starbucks? Because I like you a latte.
My coffee is really hot. But you're hotter.
I had to clean my filter twice after I saw how beautiful you are, because I couldn’t believe my Arabicas.
I know you’ve turned me down before, but I’m asking for an extra shot.
Black coffee. A purist. I give my stamp of approval.
Hark! An angel has fallen to grounds.
I like my ladies like I like my coffee - a hot shock to the lap.
Wanna go on a doppio date?
You’re looking very non-fat these days.
Is that a steam wand in your pocket?
Don’t add honey to that chamomile, you’re already too sweet.
I like my baristas like I like my coffee - hot, sweet, and creamy.
I like the way you espresso yourself.
Hold the sugar please, you're sweet enough for the both of us.
I'm going to start watching my caffeine intake, because baby you make my heart palpitate.
I’ve got a love story for you: Long black meets flat white.
You giving me your number sounds like a fair trade.
If you need to take it slow, I can cold-brew.
I bet you don’t like drips.
Do you want me to grind that for you?
Baby, chai-know you’ve been thinkin’ ‘bout me.
I’m very gentle on the frothing knob.
You roast my heart.
That's a nice mug you got on ya.
Been thinking about you a latte
Can you pass the coffee and sugar because you just made me cream in my pants
Excuse me, is your name Earl Grey? Because you look like a hot-tea!
Are you a faulty French press because I'd like to be burned by you and recall you afterwards.
Are you a chai because I’d like to get dirty. 
I can feel something brewing between the two of us.
