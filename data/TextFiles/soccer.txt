I bet you play soccer, because you're a keeper.
You know... Soccer players can go for 90 minutes and know 11 different positions...
Are you Suarez? Cause I'll let you bite me all night.
If I buy a soccer ball, will you kick it with me?
I won't give you a yellow card if you take off your shirt.
Are you David Beckham? Because I'd bend for you.
I must say, you're more beautiful than the beautiful game.
You wanna score or just knock around my balls?
You're allowed to use your hands in this game.
Do you play soccer? Because I think I'm gonna score tonight.
Can I be one of the men in your box?
If you were a soccer ball, I'd never shoot. Because I would always miss you.
I can go 90 minutes without stopping.
I'm like Arsenal: I'll stay on top but I'll finish second.
Baby I can be Spain and you can be Ireland, tonight. In other words, I'm gonna screw you hard!
You're allowed to use your hands in this game.
