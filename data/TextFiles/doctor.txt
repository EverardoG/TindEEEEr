My sudden protracted cardiac arrhythmia makes me think I'm falling for you.
(Hold out a stethoscope) Why don’t you listen to your heart and go out with me?
My adductor isn't the only thing that's longus.
I wish I was your coronary artery, so that I could be wrapped around your heart.
Is your name Osteoporosis? Because you're giving me a serious bone condition.
Trust me, this is how they did Mammograms back in the old days.
Is your name Flecainide? Because I think you just made my heart skip a beat.
Are you a pulmonary embolism? 'Cause I can't breathe when I'm around you.
(Look for any small skin imperfection) Has anyone ever looked at that? Why don’t we go back to my place so I can give you a full exam?
When you walked in the door your beauty hit me so hard that I have a priapism from all the trauma.
How about we ditch this joint and go study some anatomy? Baby, you make me vasodilate!
No that's not an epi-pen in my pants, I'm just happy to see you.
Hey baby, wanna play with my corpus cavernosum?
Are you my Appendix? Because I have a funny feeling in my stomach that makes me feel like I should take you out.
That pulsation in my femoral sheath isn't coming from an artery.
I am an organ donor, need anything?
Come into my office and take off your pants.
